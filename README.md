# Emotion-Recognition
Emotion Recognition from audio samples

Here I have used the Ravdess dataset, tess dataset and savee datatsets to train a MLP Classifier to achieve a 78% accuracy at predicting the emotion in an audio track.

The emotions that I have distinguised between are neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust and surprised.

I have extracted the mfccs, mel and chroma from the .wav file and then used that information to train the neural network.
